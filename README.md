Livia Schiavinato Eberlin is a Brazilian analytical chemist who won a MacArthur "Genius" Fellowship for her research on the use of mass spectrometry to detect cancerous tissue. In her research, she developed a pen-like device, "The Cancer Pen", that she claims can detect cancerous tissue by touching it during surgery, freezing and slicing it, and examining the slices under a microscope ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livia_S._Eberlin))
